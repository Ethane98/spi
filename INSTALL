(If you use build_sp.sh to build self-propelled instrumentation package, then ignore the instructions below.)
 

1. Copy example-make.config to be "make.config".
2. Edit make.config to define each macro variable.
  - DYNINST_DIR: absolute path of Dyninst, which contains directories like dyninstAPI, parseAPI, ...
  - SP_DIR: absolute path of this package (the output of `pwd`), because this file is also used by Makefile, I don't put `pwd` in it.
  - PLATFORM: if it runs on x86 64-bit linux, then put "x86_64-unknown-linux2.4"; if it runs on x86 32-bit linux, then put "i386-unknown-linux2.4".
  - LD_LIBRARY_PATH: place library paths for self-propelled instrumentation, dyninst, stackwalker, libelf, libdwarf, and libxml2
3. Define the global environment variable SP_DIR to point to the spi installation directory


Environment variables related to self-propelled instrumentation:
1. SP_COREDUMP, which enables core dump when segfault happens
2. SP_DEBUG, which enables printing out debugging messages, but this requires to recompile the libagent.so without defining SP_RELEASE.
