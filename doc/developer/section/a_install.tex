\section{Installation}
This appendix describes how to build SecSTAR from source code, which can be downloaded from \url{http://www.paradyn.org} or \url{http://www.dyninst.org}. \\

\textbf \underline{BUILDING ON UNIX}\\
Before starting to build SecSTAR, you have to make sure that you have already installed and built Dyninst. (refer http://www.dyninst.org/sites/default/files/manuals/dyninst/dyninstProgGuide.pdf - Appendix D for building Dyninst) \\

Building SecSTAR on UNIX platforms is a very simple three step process that involves: unpacking the SecSTAR source, configuring paths in config.mk, and running the build. \\

\textbf{1. Unpacking the SecSTAR source:} \\
SecSTAR’s source code is packaged in a -----(tar.gz) format. If your SecSTAR source tarball is called \textit{src\_SecSTAR.tar.gz}, then you could extract it with the commands \textit{gunzip src\_SecSTAR.tar.gz ; tar –xvf src\_SecSTAR.tar}. This will create a list of directories and files.  \\

\textbf{2. Configuring paths in config.mk} \\
After unpacking,the next thing is to set DYNINST\_ROOT, PLATFORM, and LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH environment variables in.  \\
{\textit DYNINST\_ROOT} should be set to path of the directory that contains subdirectories like dyninstAPI, parse API etc.,  i.e. within dyninst directory SP\_DIR should be set to the the path of the current working directory (where self propelled instrumentation is installed). \\

\$DYNLINK should be set true for building agent as a small shared library that relies on other shared libraries. Otherwise, a single huge shared library that static-linked all libraries(doubt) \\

\$PLATFORM should be set to one of the following values depending upon what operating system you are running on: \\
\begin{itemize}
  \item i386-unknown-linux 2.4: Linux 2.4/2.6 on an Intel x86 processor
  \item x86\_64-unknown-linux2.4: Linux 2.4/2.6 on an AMD-64/Intel x86-64 processor
\end{itemize}

Before building, you should also check whether \$LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH variable is set. If you are using bash shell, then open ~/.bashrc file and check if \$LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH is already present. If not, then LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH variable should be set in a way that it includes  \${DYNINST\_LIB PATH} directories.  If you are using C shell, then do the above mentioned tasks in ~/.cshrc file. \\
 
\textbf{3. Building SecSTAR:} \\
Once config.mk is set, you are ready to build SecSTAR. Move to \$PLATFORM directory  and execute the command \textit{make}. This will build ------(Dyninst’s mutator library, the Dyninst runtime library, and Dyninst’s test suite). ---- (Successfully built binaries will be stored in a directory named after your platform at the same level as the dyninst directory) \\
