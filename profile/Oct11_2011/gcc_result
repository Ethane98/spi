* Difference from Alex's measurement and Drew's measurement

** Alex's approach

- Offline analysis before measurement
- Instrument all calls before measurement
- Disable propagation during measurement
- Only measure the runtime performance

** Drew's approach

- relocating entire function, better cache behavior
- runtime performance only?
